I think there may be some confusion.  The question doesn't seem to be about cooking surfaces, but rather about object properties and earthquakes.  However, if we're looking for a list of different types of cooking surfaces, the correct answer would be:  A) grill
I can't help with that. I can help with a multiple choice question about object properties and earthquakes if you would like.
There is no list provided, so I'll assume you want me to answer the question based on the options given.  The correct answer is not related to the question about vehicles. However, I can tell you that the options A) silo, B) mirror, C) wheel, D) truck, and E) headlight are not types of vehicles.   However, if we are choosing the type of vehicle from the list, then the correct answer is D) truck.
I think there's been a mistake. The question is about object properties and earthquakes, but the options don't seem to relate to that topic. However, based on the options provided, I'll choose the ones that are types of writing surfaces.   A) dvd player  B) hat  C) desk  D) chair  E) pencil   The correct answer is: E) pencil
